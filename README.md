## FAQ

- I need help
  - Open an issue on GitHub, I will try my best to respond.

- Does this support IPS 5
  - With IPS5 plugins are depricated, so no, this will not work - if time allows, i might re-write this as an application.

- Can I have this in my own langauge?
  - Maybe? if you know how to do it, I'll accept a PR.

- You've written X incorrectly, it should be Y
  - Amazing! Documentation on IPS is dreadful (even worse than my own sometimes) - feel free to open a PR with the fix.
